abstract = {We describe new algorithms of the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method for symmetric eigenvalue problems, based on a local optimization of a three-term recurrence, and suggest several other new methods. To be able to compare numerically different methods in the class, with different preconditioners, we propose a common system of model tests, using random preconditioners and initial guesses. As the "ideal" control algorithm, we advocate the standard preconditioned conjugate gradient method for finding an eigenvector as an element of the null-space of the corresponding homogeneous system of linear equations under the assumption that the eigenvalue is known. We recommend that every new preconditioned eigensolver be compared with this "ideal" algorithm on our model test problems in terms of the speed of convergence, costs of every iteration, and memory requirements. We provide such comparison for our LOBPCG method. Numerical results establish that our algorithm is practicall...},

abstract = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modern physics and simulation problems has led to the development of massively parallel computers, and has sparked much research into developing algorithms for them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however. While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously introduced a parallel algorithm [A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] for the selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the application of heuristics designed to insure the quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary, R.D., Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones [in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] as well as other approaches to parallelizing the coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the basic schemes, designed to address specific performance issues. We present numerical results for a broad range of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we indicate the current directions of the research. {\textcopyright} 2002 IMACS. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
